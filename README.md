# TODO/Notebook app

> Example Vue project.

Be sure to check out the [Lumen API](https://bitbucket.org/jacobg213/todo-api) that this app is based on!

## Before you start
* Setup the Lumen API mentioned above first to make use of all the functions.
* Go to `src/config.js` file and update the Domain const with you API's domain name.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
